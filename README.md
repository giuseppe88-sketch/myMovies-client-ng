# myMovies-client-Angular

Whit in this project I build the client-side component of a “movies” web application. The web
application will provide users with access to information about different
movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their
personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.

## User stories

* As a user, I want to be able to receive information on movies, directors, and genres so that I
can learn more about movies I’ve watched or am interested in.
* As a user, I want to be able to create a profile so I can save data about my favorite movies.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
